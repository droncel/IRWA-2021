# IRWA-2021
Final project of Information Retrieval and Web Analytics course in Pompeu Fabra University.

This project is developed by group 16:
- Martina Carrés, U162438, martina.carres01@estudiant.upf.edu
- Begoña López, U161810, begona.lopez02@estudiant.upf.edu
- Daniel Roncel, U161820, daniel.roncel01@estudiant.upf.edu

# Part 1
Find the first delivery of the project in the IRWA-2021-final-project-part-1 tag.

To run the code of the first delivery of the final project, you must have installed the following libraries:
- nltk
- json
- demoji
- re
- GoogleTranslator

# Part 2
Find the second delivery of the project in the IRWA-2021-final-project-part-2 tag.The code is in Indexing_Evaluation_U161820_U161810_U162438.ipynb

To evaluate the search system there are two options:
1. Evaluate yourself the relevance of the resulting tweets.
2. Use the relevance judgement already done, which are defined as text in the notebook. You only need to copy them in a code cell.

# Part 3
Find the third delivery of the project in the IRWA-2021-final-project-part-3 tag. The code is in Ranking_U161820_U161810_U162438.ipynb

The code until 'Create the index' section, included, is to preprocess the tweets and create the index. Just below there are 3 section, one for each ranking algorithm. The use of the 3 ranking algorithms is very straightforward: after the implementation of each of them there is a cell for testing it with any query you like.

At the end of the notebook you there is the ranking of Word2Vec + Cosine Similarity implementation for the 5 queries selected in the part 2 of this project.
